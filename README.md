# godot-learning

A place to keep notes about the Godot game engine. A majority of the notes come from the [Godot Docs site](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html), and are just written down/remixed so I remember them. If you are learning Godot, please start there.

Over time, as I learn more and am able to start making my own conclusions, more of those will appear here.
